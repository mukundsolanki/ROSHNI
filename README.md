# ROSHNI üëÅÔ∏è
AI-powered smart-companion glasses for the visually impaired.

## Problem statement and target audience
we are aiming to help partially blind people with our solution which is commonly caused due to the following:
* Diabetic Retinopathy
* Macular Degeneration
* Glaucoma
* Cataracts

## Solution we are providing
* OCR using Google Cloud Vision API
* Scene Analysis
* Object Detection using YOLOv5
* Face Recognition and training
* Surveillance application with voice communication

## Cost efficiency of our hardware
* Our product costs just 1.4% of what our competitors do. (Envision Glasses)
* Envision Glasses costs 2,00,000 Rs+ vs Roshni which costs approximately 3,000 Rs
* Envision Glasses subscription costs 12,000 Rs+ per month vs. Roshni which costs approximately 500 Rs.
* Better after-sales because of modular design

## Efficiency
* OCR implemented using GCV API takes ~2sec on average.
* The face_recognition model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
* YOLOv5 model has an accuracy of ~94%

## Tech stack
* Python
* React
* JavaScript
* Raspberry Pi 3b
* Touch Capacitor
* Pi camera

# Installation and usages
```conda activate myenv && python -m venv myenv && source myenv/bin/activate```
